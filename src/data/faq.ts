    question: "How is Blynked different from a lead gen agency?",
    answer:
      "Lead gen agencies hand you a list of names. We build a complete revenue system \u2014 positioning, pipeline, sales enablement, and scalability. Our Traction Framework covers the full funnel so you\u2019re not just getting leads, you\u2019re closing them.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of companies do you work with?",
    answer:
      "B2B tech companies \u2014 software development firms, SaaS companies, and digital agencies \u2014 typically with 10-100 employees who\u2019ve outgrown referral-only growth and need a systematic pipeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long until we see results?",
    answer:
      "Most clients see their first qualified meetings within 2-4 weeks. Full pipeline transformation typically takes 3-6 months depending on your market and starting point.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you replace our sales team?",
    answer:
      "No. We build the system that feeds your sales team with pre-qualified opportunities. We handle positioning, outbound, and pipeline generation \u2014 your team handles closing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the engagement look like month-to-month?",
    answer:
      "We start with a deep-dive into your market and positioning (Week 1-2), then build and launch your pipeline system (Week 3-5), followed by optimization and scaling (Month 2+). You get a dedicated team, weekly reporting, and full transparency.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if it doesn\u2019t work?",
    answer:
      "We\u2019ve generated meetings with BMW, Walmart, KPN, and dozens of other enterprise targets. But if the fit isn\u2019t right, we\u2019ll tell you upfront during our strategy call rather than waste your time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      "Our partnerships start from \u20AC3,000/month depending on scope and goals. We\u2019ll give you a clear proposal after understanding your situation on a strategy call.",
  },
